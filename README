Options to pass as variable:
    "rms", "trace", "trace_hist" and "spec"

Options to pass calibration:
    "linear" and "full"

Notes to self:
use as event selection:
    type: "PHYSICS"
    trigger rate < 2 Hz (higher trigger rates are probably windy/human activity periods)

BROKEN RUNS:
The dataset contains several broken/incomplete runs. To filter these a python program sweeps over all runs and stores the run_nr of the ones that fail to load. These numbers are stored in broken_runs/stationX.pickle. The main.py program uses these broken run pickle files to ignore the broken runs. An example of a broken run is station 24, run 363, event 105 is broken (200 header entries, but only 100 waveforms)

Calibration:
The calibration is available but for season 22 data we choose to use a linear calibration. The reason is that the amount of bias scans in the chosen time frame is limited.

Potential artifacts:
    Have a look at ringing, which can be caused be the deconvolution of the detector out of the trace

What to do with G = 0? this represents e.g. a bandpass filter.
This information is lost so what value should be used as placeholder or this should be deleted?
For the purpose of thermal noise from ice I assume these can be set to 0 since the signal here is purely electronics noise? -> The solution was to use a bandpass filter which anyways focuses on "normal" response values.

BE CAREFUL WHEN TAKING MEANS
When looking into noise taking the mean over many noise events will yield a trace very close to 0. This because the random fluctuations interfere destructively. One should only take the mean over the final calculated variable.

USE OF CODE
Do not forget to add the root directory "noise_study" to the pythonpath e.g. in an alias


currently use ~/Documents/data/noise_study/data/average_ft/job_2025_02_21_test/station23/clean/average_ft.pickle as data file
